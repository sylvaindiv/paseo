# Handoff Skill

Transfer the current task — context, decisions, failed attempts, constraints — to a fresh agent. The receiving agent starts with **zero context**, so the handoff prompt must be a self-contained briefing.

**User's arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

## Choose the role first

You are the **receiver/executor** when your initial prompt contains
`PASEO_WORKFLOW_HANDOFF` with `mode: "receiver"`, a `workflowId`, a `planId`, and
an executor role: `executor-trivial`, `executor-bounded`, `executor-diagnostic`,
`executor-complex`, `executor-critical`, or legacy `executor-standard` / `executor-advanced`;
or your current agent labels
contain the matching `paseo.workflow.id`, `paseo.workflow.plan`, and executor role.
If both are available they must match; stop and report a mismatch.

As receiver, execute the supplied plan **here**, in this agent and workspace:

1. Read the approved, self-contained plan and the git base and dirty state. The plan contains
   the task context and decisions; the original request and conversation are not included.
2. Follow the approved plan and its explicit authorization limits; they take precedence
   over generic workflow instructions. Preserve pre-existing and concurrent changes.
3. Run targeted checks, review the resulting diff, and report the local result and any blockers.
4. Stage, commit, push, merge, deploy, synchronize local branches, or cause external effects
   only when explicitly authorized by the user or the approved plan. The handoff itself grants
   none of these permissions. When staging or committing is authorized, include only your own
   files/hunks after successful validation.

A validated local result without a commit is valid when no commit was authorized.
Do not create a commit to satisfy a workflow gate; report that gate as a workflow limitation.

Do not create another agent, select a receiving profile, or perform the initiator
steps below. The handoff has already happened. Deadline pressure does not change
the receiver role. If implementation or validation is blocked, report the blocker
in this conversation; do not delegate it away.

Without that receiver payload or those labels, you are the **initiator**. Follow
the remaining sections to transfer the task to a new agent.

## Prerequisites

Read the **paseo** skill. Call `list_profiles` before choosing the receiving agent. Do not create it until you have read the configured profiles and their `notes`.

## Parsing arguments

1. **Agent profile** — explicit profile name first; otherwise choose the profile whose `notes` best match the work. Materialize it into `create_agent` as described by the **paseo** skill. If no profile fits, use Paseo's provider discovery fallback.
2. **Isolation** — "in a worktree" / "worktree" → create a workspace with `isolation: "worktree"`, using a short branch name derived from the task.
3. **Task description** — anything else the user said.

## The handoff prompt

The receiving agent has zero context. Include:

```
## Task
[Imperative description.]

## Context
[Why this task exists, required context.]

## Relevant files
- `path/to/file.ts` — [what it is and why it matters]

## Current state
[What's done, what works, what doesn't.]

## What was tried
- [Approach] — [why it failed or was abandoned]

## Decisions
- [Decision — rationale]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [Criterion]

## Constraints
- [Must-not / must-preserve]
```

**Preserve task semantics.** Investigate-only → "DO NOT edit files." Fix → "implement the fix." Refactor → "refactor, not rewrite." Carry the user's exact intent.

## Launch

Prepare the handoff in a dedicated workspace:

1. Select the current workspace or call `create_workspace` with the requested isolation.
2. Call `create_agent` with a `[Handoff] <task>` title, the briefing as initial prompt, and the selected `workspaceId` when explicit placement is needed.
3. Return the agent and workspace to the user, explaining that it remains in your subagent track until they detach it manually.

Do not encode independence as a create mode and do not invoke CLI or wire-level detach operations. Detach is a user gesture in the subagents track.

Do not wait or poll for the agent to finish.
